# Basic Projects: Learn Electronics Fundamentals Through Building

## Overview

These 12 basic projects teach core electronics concepts through hands-on breadboard work.

**Prerequisites**: Understanding of resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes

**Time per project**: 30–60 minutes

**Difficulty**: Absolute beginner → fundamental understanding

1. **LED with Current-Limiting Resistor** - Learn Ohm's law through LED protection
2. **Simple Series Resistors** - Understand resistance addition
3. **Parallel Resistor Network** - Learn current division
4. **Voltage Divider** - Fundamental analog circuit building block
5. **Pushbutton LED Control** - First switch interaction
6. **LED Brightness Control (Potentiometer)** - Variable resistance
7. **Capacitor Charging/Discharging** - Time constants in action
8. **Capacitor Filtering** - See noise reduction in real time
9. **Diode Protection Circuit** - Understand diode blocking/conducting
10. **Simple LED Flasher (Transistor)** - Introduction to transistor switching
11. **Series/Parallel Capacitor Circuit** - Capacitance combinations
12. **Power Dissipation Measurement** - Feel heat, understand watts

## Learning Progression

**Week 1: Current & Voltage**
- LED with current-limiting resistor
- Series resistors
- Parallel resistors
- Voltage divider

**Week 2: Control & Interaction**
- Pushbutton LED control
- LED brightness with potentiometer
- Diode protection circuit

**Week 3: Time & Storage**
- Capacitor charging/discharging
- Capacitor filtering
- Series/parallel capacitors

**Week 4: Power & Switching**
- Power dissipation measurement
- Simple LED flasher

## Tools Required

- Breadboard (solderless)
- Wire strippers and jumper wires
- Multimeter (essential for verification)
- Oscilloscope (optional but helpful for timing)
- 5V power supply or battery pack
- USB power bank (convenient alternative)

## Safety Considerations

- ✓ Always verify polarity before power
- ✓ Never exceed component voltage/current ratings
- ✓ Measure first, power second
- ✓ Component resistors get warm but not hot (if hot, you've exceeded power rating)
- ✓ LED polarity: longer lead is positive (anode)

## Getting the Most from These Projects

1. **Build exactly as shown first** (learn the pattern)
2. **Measure every voltage and current** (verify theory)
3. **Modify the circuit** (change resistor values, add components)
4. **Predict behavior** (before modifying, guess what will happen)
5. **Verify prediction** (measure to see if you were right)

## Before You Start

1. **Read the component basics** from the fundamentals course
2. **Understand what you're building** (read project description first)
3. **Gather all components** (nothing worse than halfway through, missing parts)
4. **Plan 30–60 minutes** (don't rush, enjoy the learning)
5. **Have multimeter ready** (measure everything)

Start with **Project 1: LED with Current-Limiting Resistor** to learn the basics, then progress through in order. Each project builds on previous knowledge.

Happy building!
