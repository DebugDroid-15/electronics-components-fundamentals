## Difficulty Ratings

Each project marked with ⭐ scale:

- ⭐⭐ = Intermediate (requires 1-2 hours, builds on basic concepts)
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Advanced intermediate (requires 2+ hours, new concepts)

## Getting Started

### Before Your First Intermediate Project
1. Gather components from shopping list
2. Review all basic project theory (especially 1, 4, 7, 10)
3. Ensure multimeter works properly
4. Read project 1 completely before building

### During Each Project
1. Read all theory before building
2. Build step-by-step as written
3. Measure before troubleshooting
4. Do challenge extensions (deepens learning)

### After Each Project
1. Clean breadboard
2. Test all components still work
3. Store components in labeled containers
4. Review key concepts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping basic projects** - Intermediate depends heavily on basic understanding
2. **Not measuring** - Multimeter is your best debugging tool
3. **IC pins reversed** - Always check pinout diagrams carefully
4. **Capacitor polarity wrong** - Electrolytics are sensitive to reverse voltage
5. **Pushing transistors too hard** - Follow current ratings in datasheets
6. **Assuming IC outputs drive loads** - Usually need transistor amplification
7. **Not reading datasheets** - Critical for IC-based projects

## Safety Reminders

⚠️ **High Power**: Some projects exceed 100mA—be careful with power supplies
⚠️ **Component Heat**: Transistors and regulators may get hot—don't touch
⚠️ **Polarity Sensitive**: Wrong capacitor polarity destroys components
⚠️ **IC Damage**: Static electricity can destroy CMOS ICs—touch breadboard to ground first
